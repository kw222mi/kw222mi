### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I embarked on an exciting journey by studying Marketing Communication and IT at Stockholm University, where I dove into the world of programming with Java, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. After graduation, I delved into the dynamic realm of e-commerce, where my passion for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript flourished. Eager to expand my horizons, I pursued further education in web development at Linnaeus University, immersing myself in JavaScript for both frontend and backend development. This adventure introduced me to fascinating technologies like Node.js, Express.js, Docker, and MongoDB, sparking my curiosity even more. Seeking to refine my frontend skills, I enrolled in a React.js, SASS, and TypeScript course at Lexicon. Now, my aim is to continue exploring the vibrant world of frontend development, blending technical prowess with creative flair, all while embracing the joy of continual learning and personal growth.
